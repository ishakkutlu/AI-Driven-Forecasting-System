# AI-Driven Banknote Forecasting System

## üîç Overview  

Forecasting banknote demand is a critical challenge for central banks, since banknotes in circulation depend on many external and macroeconomic factors.  

This AI-driven forecasting system addresses the problem by combining **48 models** (neural networks + classical time series). Originally developed as a high-impact prototype at the Central Bank of the Republic of T√ºrkiye, it was trained and validated on **real-world national and regional data**.  

It achieved forecast accuracies ranging from **~65% to ~99%** (SMAPE), delivering strategic insights that supported monetary stability and efficient banknote management.  

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Implementation scope (48 models)**  
  Machine learning (LSTM, MLP/FNN, TLNN) and time series (SARIMA) models; applied to six denominations (‚Ç∫5‚Ä¶‚Ç∫200) at national & regional scales (4 √ó 6 √ó 2 = 48).
  All models evaluated under a consistent, leakage-safe protocol with train/validation/test splits using past-only windows.

- **Training & modeling safeguards**  
  Neural networks: early stopping, loss monitoring to prevent overfitting, and normalization for stable training.  
  Time series: stationarity/seasonality checks, model selection, and residual diagnostics to ensure robustness and validity.  

- **Metrics & interpretability**  
  RMSE to assess errors in real-world units (domain-level interpretability).  
  SMAPE as the main reporting metric, also expressed as Accuracy (100 ‚àí SMAPE) for clear comparison and communication.

- **Reproducibility**  
  National-level datasets are public, ensuring end-to-end reproducibility.  
  Regional datasets restricted; only aggregated metrics and figures shared.  

## üìä Real-World Impact  

- **High accuracy & decision support**  
  Forecast accuracies ranged from ~65% to ~99% (SMAPE), delivering actionable insights for both national and regional allocation decisions.

- **Simplicity with real-world impact**  
  Forecasts relied only on the banknote demand series itself ‚Äî no external variables required.  
  This made the system easy to set up and directly usable in practice, while still achieving high accuracy.

- **Longer-term planning**  
  Produced 12-month forecasts with confidence intervals, helping decision-makers prepare for seasonal patterns.  
  Ongoing train/validation/test monitoring ensured reliability and strengthened confidence in forecasts used for cash management planning.

- **Operational & policy relevance**  
  Supported not only cash logistics but also upstream needs such as banknote production, supply chain preparation, and long-term stock management.  
  As circulation volume drives monetary liquidity, forecasts offered critical input for monetary policy.  

**Neural networks consistently outperformed SARIMA, ensuring higher reliability across denominations and scales.**
