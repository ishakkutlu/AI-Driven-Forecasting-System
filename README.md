# AI-Driven Banknote Forecasting System

## üîç Overview  

Forecasting banknote demand is a critical challenge for central banks, since banknotes in circulation depend on many external and macroeconomic factors.  

This AI-driven system addresses the problem by using a dual-path forecasting architecture, combining time-series models for structural interpretability with neural networks for adaptive learning.  

Originally developed and validated as a high-impact prototype at the Central Bank of the Republic of T√ºrkiye, it was applied to **48 models** across **real-world national and regional datasets**. Due to confidentiality constraints, only the **24 national-scale models** are shared in this public repository.  

It achieved median-based forecast accuracies up to **97%** (1‚àíSMAPE), delivering strategic insights that supported monetary stability and efficient banknote management.

## ‚ú® Key Features  

- **Hybrid forecasting architecture (SARIMA + Neural Networks)**  
  Machine learning (LSTM, MLP/FNN, TLNN) and time series (SARIMA) models; applied to six denominations (‚Ç∫5‚Ä¶‚Ç∫200) at national scale, resulting in 24 trained and validated models (4 √ó 6).  
  All models were evaluated under a consistent, leakage-safe protocol with **train / validation / test splits using past-only windows**.  

- **Robustness over single-run performance**  
  Neural networks were trained with multiple random seeds, and results were reported using **median-seed performance** rather than isolated "best runs".  
  This ensured that **model selection favored stability and decision reliability**, not just peak accuracy.  

- **Training & modeling safeguards**  
  Neural networks: early stopping, loss monitoring, learning-rate scheduling, regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, deterministic initializers for reproducibility, and normalization for stable training.  
  Time series: stationarity/seasonality checks, model selection, and residual diagnostics to ensure robustness and validity.  
  Together, these mechanisms ensured **smooth convergence**, **generalization beyond the training period**, and **consistent behavior across multiple runs**.   

 - **Metrics & interpretability**  
  RMSE to assess errors in real-world units (domain-level interpretability).  
  SMAPE as the main reporting metric, also expressed as accuracy (100 ‚àí SMAPE) for clear comparison and communication.  
  Additional stability indicators such as NRMSE and seed-based CV/IQR included to reflect consistency rather than isolated peak scores.

## üìä Real-World Impact  

- **Actionable accuracy & decision support**  
  Median-based forecast accuracies up to 97% (SMAPE), delivering reliable insights for both national and regional allocation decisions.  

- **Practical by design**  
  Forecasts relied only on the banknote demand series itself ‚Äî no external variables required.  
  This made the system easy to set up and directly usable in practice, while still achieving high accuracy.  

- **Supports both short-term response and long-term planning**  
  Produced 12-month forecasts with confidence intervals, helping decision-makers prepare for seasonal patterns.  
  Supported not only cash logistics but also upstream needs such as banknote production, supply chain preparation, and long-term stock management.  

**SARIMA provided a stable statistical baseline, while neural networks added adaptive gains‚Äîespecially in volatile denominations‚Äîoffering more reliable signals for allocation decisions.**
