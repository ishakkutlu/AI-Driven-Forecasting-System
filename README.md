# AI-Driven Banknote Forecasting System

## üîç Overview  
Forecasting banknote demand is a critical challenge for central banks, since banknotes in circulation depend on many external and macroeconomic factors. Accurate forecasts are essential for monetary stability and efficient cash management.  

This system addresses the problem by combining 48 forecasting models with artificial intelligence (neural networks) and classical time series approaches. Developed at the Central Bank of the Republic of T√ºrkiye, it was a high-impact prototype trained and validated on real-world national and regional data. The system achieved up to 99% accuracy (SMAPE), delivering strategic insights for more precise and efficient banknote allocation planning.

## Key Highlights
- Developed 48 models covering national and regional levels.
- Achieved up to 99% accuracy using SMAPE metric.
- Implemented early stopping, loss monitoring, and data normalization.
- Conducted comparative analysis between AI models and SARIMA.
- Utilized Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pmdarima, Statsmodels, Matplotlib.

## Visual Results
Below are selected visuals demonstrating the forecasting performance and evaluation results of the AI-based system across different models, denominations, and regions.

### Evaluation Metrics ‚Äì National vs Regional (SMAPE %)
- Evaluation of 4 models across 6 denominations using SMAPE as the main metric.
- AI models (LSTM, TLNN, FNN) generally outperformed SARIMA at both national and regional levels.

### Forecasting Results ‚Äì National Level
#### Forecasting ‚Äì National Level (200 TL)
- Trained on historical demand data and projected 12 months ahead.
- FNN and LSTM delivered more accurate projections during the test period (2022), closely tracking real demand.
- TLNN and SARIMA showed weaker generalization during unexpected surges.

#### Loss Curves & Residual Autocorrelation ‚Äì National Level (200 TL)
- The 200 TL models show stable convergence in both training and validation losses across all neural networks.
- SARIMA's residuals showed no significant autocorrelation.
- These help assess overfitting and model consistency, with early stopping applied to the neural models to retain optimal performance.

#### Forecasting ‚Äì National Level (50 TL)
- Strong seasonal signals were observed and well tracked by neural models.
- SARIMA captured the overall trend but with less precision and higher uncertainty.

#### Forecasting ‚Äì National Level (5 TL)
- All models captured seasonal demand patterns.
- Neural models (LSTM, TLNN, FNN) showed slightly better alignment with actual trends than SARIMA, which had wider forecast uncertainty.

### Forecasting Results ‚Äì Regional Level

#### Forecasting ‚Äì Regional Level (200 TL)
- FNN, LSTM, and TLNN maintained accuracy despite regional volatility.
- SARIMA underperformed in capturing irregular demand fluctuations.

#### Forecasting ‚Äì Regional Level (5 TL)
- All models followed the regional demand trend with clear seasonality.
- Neural networks closely tracked actual values, though with slight underestimation across most months.
- SARIMA showed higher forecast variance and slightly less stable fit.
